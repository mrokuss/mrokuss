## Hi there 👋

I'm Max, a PhD researcher at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), working at the intersection of deep learning and medical imaging. My research centers on segmentation, temporality and text—developing promptable, interactive tools for longitudinal analysis, tracking, and multimodal understanding. I aim to make these technologies intuitive, reliable, and accessible for both research and clinical use.

### 🧠 My Projects

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnInteractive](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnInteractive): A comprehensive 3D interactive segmentation method supporting diverse prompts like points, scribbles, boxes, and a novel lasso prompt integrated into widely used image viewers like Napari, MITK and 3D Slicer.

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LesionLocator](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LesionLocator) (CVPR25): A framework for zero-shot universal tumor segmentation and tracking in 3D whole-body imaging combining a large-scale lesion dataset, promptable segmentation, and deep-learning-based image registration.

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LongiSeg](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LongiSeg) (MICCAI24 LDTM Oral): An extension of the nnU-Net framework tailored for longitudinal medical image segmentation incorporating temporal information across multiple timepoints..

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/Skeleton-Recall](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/Skeleton-Recall) (ECCV24): A loss function designed to enhance connectivity conservation in thin tubular structure segmentation without incurring massive computational overheads.

I'm also a maintainer and contributor to the well-known [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) framework—one of the cornerstones of modern medical image segmentation.

Aside from my main projects I regularly participate in a variety of challenges in the MICCAI and other communities:

- 🥇 **Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation @ CVPR 2025** – First place using nnInteractive
- 🥇 **autoPET @ MICCAI 2024** – First place in PET/CT lesion segmentation across multiple tracers and centers  
- 🥇 **TopCoW @ MICCAI 2023** – First place in multiclass brain vasculature segmentation  
- 🥇 **ToothFairy @ MICCAI 2024** – Part of the winning team in CBCT segmentation for surgical planning  
- 🥉 **AortaSeg @ MICCAI 2024** – Third place in high-resolution aortic multiclass segmentation  
- 💰 **Kaggle Vesuvius Challenge 2023** – 7th out of 1514, $5,000 prize for ancient ink detection
