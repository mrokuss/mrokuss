## Hi there üëã

I'm Max, a PhD researcher at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), working at the intersection of deep learning and medical imaging. My research centers on segmentation, temporality and text‚Äîdeveloping promptable, interactive tools for longitudinal analysis, tracking, and multimodal understanding. I aim to make these technologies intuitive, reliable, and accessible for both research and clinical use.

### üß† My Projects

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnInteractive](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnInteractive): A comprehensive 3D interactive segmentation method supporting diverse prompts like points, scribbles, boxes, and a novel lasso prompt integrated into widely used image viewers like Napari, MITK and 3D Slicer.

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LesionLocator](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LesionLocator) (CVPR25): A framework for zero-shot universal tumor segmentation and tracking in 3D whole-body imaging combining a large-scale lesion dataset, promptable segmentation, and deep-learning-based image registration.

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LongiSeg](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LongiSeg) (MICCAI24 LDTM Oral): An extension of the nnU-Net framework tailored for longitudinal medical image segmentation incorporating temporal information across multiple timepoints.

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/Skeleton-Recall](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/Skeleton-Recall) (ECCV24): A loss function designed to enhance connectivity conservation in thin tubular structure segmentation without incurring massive computational overheads.

- [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/BreastDivider](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/BreastDivider) (MICCAI25 WOMEN): The first large-scale dataset and model for left/right breast segmentation in MRI, featuring over 17,000 3D scans with partial lesion annotations.


I'm also a maintainer and contributor to the well-known [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet.svg?logo=github&label=Stars)](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) framework - one of the cornerstones of modern medical image segmentation.

Aside from my main projects I regularly participate in a variety of challenges in the CVPR, MICCAI and other communities:
